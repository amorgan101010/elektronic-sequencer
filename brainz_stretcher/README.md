This started as a different app, `the_button`, but I kinda shifted gears when I switched from [`assets_audio_player`](https://pub.dev/packages/assets_audio_player) to [`soundpool`](https://pub.dev/packages/soundpool). This is a stripped down version of the Soundpool example project, with my own recording. I am sort of misusing Soundpool, as it isn't supposed to be used as a media player...but I want to familiarize myself with it. I switched to it from `assets_audio_player` because I thought there was something wrong with the latter; it actually ended up being an issue with Cocoapods on an Arm Mac, which was solved by uninstalling the Gem and re-installing it with Homebrew (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64901180/how-to-run-cocoapods-on-apple-silicon-m1>).
