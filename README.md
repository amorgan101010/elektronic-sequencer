# elektronic-sequencer

Trying to practice with Flutter by implementing a version of the Elektron sequencer.

Since I'm a noob with both Flutter and real-ish time stuff like a sequencer would require, to start this is going to be more of a "tap on squares in a grid to light them up" sort of app.

Now that I've written that out, I realize it is also going to be pretty close to Koala Sampler.
