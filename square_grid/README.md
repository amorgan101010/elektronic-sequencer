# square_grid

To build a XoX-style grid sequencer in Flutter, first I need to make a grid.

## Goals

- ~~Draw a 4x4 grid of numbered squares~~

- Give the squares an outline

- Make the squares change color when pressed

- Make the squares color toggle when pressed

- Add paging

### Optional Goals

I'll have to do 'em eventually, but maybe not in this particular project depending on progress in other areas.

- Add a color slider that changes the color of all "active" squares

- Add a basic p-lock (user presses square and selects a color on the slider for that specific square while pressing)
